# ML Prediction Models of mRS levels
Here we give access to the Machine Learning models that we developed to predict functional outcome and death at 3 months after stroke in Sweden between the period 2015 to 2020. The target variable was categorised into 3 classes (mRS 0-2: Independent, mRS 3-5: Dependent, mRS 6: Dead). While the features included:
